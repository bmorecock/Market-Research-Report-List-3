<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Destructive</li><li>Destructive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) market includes both non-destructive and destructive types. In non-destructive XPS, the sample remains intact after analysis, allowing for further testing or imaging. This type is widely used in research and quality control applications. On the other hand, destructive XPS involves altering or consuming the sample during analysis, limiting its potential for additional tests. Destructive XPS is commonly used in material identification and surface analysis where sample preservation is not a priority.</p></p>

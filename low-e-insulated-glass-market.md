<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low-E Insulated Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hard Coated</li><li>Soft Coated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Low-E insulated glass is a type of energy-efficient glass that helps to reduce heat loss and improve insulation in buildings. There are two main types of Low-E coatings: hard coated and soft coated. Hard coated Low-E glass is created by applying a thin layer of metal oxide to the glass during the manufacturing process, making it durable and more scratch-resistant. Soft coated Low-E glass, on the other hand, involves applying a thin layer of silver or other metals onto the glass surface after it has been manufactured, providing better solar control and energy efficiency.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Deferasirox Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transfusional Iron Overload</li><li>NTDT Caused Iron Overload</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Deferasirox is primarily used in the treatment of iron overload caused by regular blood transfusions and non-transfusion dependent thalassemia (NTDT). Transfusional iron overload occurs when the body accumulates excess iron due to frequent blood transfusions, while NTDT caused iron overload is a common complication in patients with thalassemia who do not require regular transfusions. Deferasirox helps to remove excess iron from the body and prevent associated complications such as organ damage and heart problems in both conditions.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wireless Fire Detection Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Addressable Wireless Fire Detection Systems</li><li>Conventional Wireless Fire Detection Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wireless fire detection systems are divided into two main types - addressable and conventional. Addressable wireless fire detection systems use individual devices that can be uniquely identified and communicate wirelessly with a central control panel. This allows for specific location information in case of a fire. On the other hand, conventional wireless fire detection systems use zones to group multiple devices together, providing a more basic level of detection without the ability to pinpoint specific locations. Both types offer benefits in terms of flexibility, ease of installation, and maintenance.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber-coupled Acousto-optic Modulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SM Fiber</li><li>SMPM Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fiber-coupled Acousto-optic Modulators are available in two main market types: SM Fiber and SMPM Fiber. SM Fiber refers to Single Mode Fiber, which offers a narrow diameter core that allows only a single mode of light to propagate through it. SMPM Fiber, on the other hand, stands for Single Mode Polarization Maintaining Fiber, which maintains the polarization state of the light signal as it travels through the fiber. Both types cater to specific needs in applications requiring high precision and stability in signal transmission.</p></p>

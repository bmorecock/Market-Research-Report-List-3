<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Retarders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>All-electric Type Retarders</li><li>Electromagnetic Type Retarders</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electric retarders market consists of two main types: all-electric type retarders and electromagnetic type retarders. All-electric type retarders use electric power to create braking force through the resistance of the rotating masses. Electromagnetic type retarders generate braking force by inducing eddy currents in a rotating metallic drum. Both types of retarders provide efficient and reliable braking for heavy vehicles, offering superior performance compared to traditional braking systems.</p></p>

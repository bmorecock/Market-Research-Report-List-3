<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automatic Continuous Variable Transmission Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Belt Connection</li><li>Chain Connection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automatic Continuous Variable Transmission (CVT) systems can be categorized into two main types: Belt Connection and Chain Connection. In the Belt Connection market, CVT systems use a belt or a metal chain to transfer power from the engine to the wheels, providing smooth and seamless acceleration without the need for gear shifting. On the other hand, in the Chain Connection market, CVT systems use a chain drive mechanism to achieve the same goal of continuous and efficient power transfer. Both types offer advantages in terms of fuel efficiency and driving comfort.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cortical Electrode Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Strip Electrode</li><li>Grid Electrode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cortical electrode market consists of two primary types: strip electrode and grid electrode. Strip electrodes are thin, rectangular electrodes that are useful for stimulating or recording from specific cortical areas. Grid electrodes, on the other hand, consist of an array of closely spaced electrodes arranged in a grid pattern, allowing for more precise stimulation and recording across a larger area of the cortex. Both types of electrodes play a crucial role in neuroscientific research, neuroprosthetics, and treating neurological disorders.</p></p>

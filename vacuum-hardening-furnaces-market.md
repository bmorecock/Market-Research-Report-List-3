<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vacuum Hardening Furnaces Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil Hardening</li><li>Gas Hardening</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vacuum hardening furnaces are used for heat treating metals to improve their mechanical properties. There are two main types of vacuum hardening furnaces: oil hardening and gas hardening. In oil hardening, the metal is heated in a vacuum environment and then quenched in oil to achieve the desired hardness. In gas hardening, the metal is heated and quenched using various gases like nitrogen or argon. Both methods are commonly used in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and tool manufacturing to produce high-quality, strong metal components.</p></p>

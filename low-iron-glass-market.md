<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low-Iron Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolled Glass</li><li>Float Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Low-iron glass is a type of glass that has a reduced iron content, resulting in higher light transmittance and clarity compared to standard glass. Two common types of low-iron glass are rolled glass and float glass. Rolled glass is made by pouring molten glass onto a metal table and then rolling it out into a sheet, while float glass is produced by floating molten glass on top of molten tin to create a smooth, uniform surface. Both types of low-iron glass are preferred for applications where maximum visibility and clarity are desired.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Held Pulse Oximeters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disposable Sensor</li><li>Reusable Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Held pulse oximeters come in two main market types: disposable sensor and reusable sensors. Disposable sensors are single-use devices that can be used once and then discarded. They are commonly used in healthcare settings where infection control is a concern. Reusable sensors, on the other hand, can be used multiple times after proper sterilization. They are more cost-effective in the long run but require more maintenance. Both types of sensors play a crucial role in monitoring oxygen levels in patients accurately and efficiently.</p></p>

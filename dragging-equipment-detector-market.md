<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dragging Equipment Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stationary Impact Plates</li><li>Traditional Paddle Set</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stationary impact plates are a type of dragging equipment detector that uses fixed plates to detect when an object is being dragged along the ground. This type of detector is commonly used in industrial settings where heavy equipment and machinery are frequently moved. Traditional paddle set detectors, on the other hand, use rotating paddles to sense when an object is being dragged. Both types of detectors serve the same purpose of alerting operators to potential hazards or malfunctions caused by dragging equipment.</p></p>

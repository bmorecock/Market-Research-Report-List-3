<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Positioner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Acting Positioner</li><li>Double Acting Positioner</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Digital positioners are devices used in industrial systems to precisely control the position of valves. Single acting positioners are designed for linear valves that need to be positioned in one direction (either open or closed). Double acting positioners, on the other hand, are used for valves that need to be positioned in both directions for precise control. Both types of positioners use digital technology to accurately adjust valve positions based on input signals, making them essential components in automated industrial processes.</p></p>

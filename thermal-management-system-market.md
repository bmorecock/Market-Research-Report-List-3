<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thermal Management System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive</li><li>Active</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Thermal Management System market can be categorized into two main types: Passive and Active. Passive thermal management systems rely on natural convection or thermal insulation to dissipate heat, while active systems use mechanical components such as fans or pumps to actively regulate temperature. Passive systems are generally simpler and quieter, but may not be as effective in high heat scenarios. Active systems provide better control over temperature regulation and are suitable for more demanding applications. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining optimal operating conditions for electronic devices.</p></p>
